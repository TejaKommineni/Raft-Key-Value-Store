# Raft-Key-Value-Store

In this project we build a fault-tolerant key-value storage service using a Raft library. The key-value service is implemented as a replicated state machine, consisting of several key-value servers that coordinate their activities through the Raft log. Our key/value service will continue to process client requests as long as a majority of the servers are alive and can communicate, in spite of other failures or network partitions.

Our system will consist of clients and key/value servers, where each key/value server also acts as a Raft peer. Clients send Put(), Append(), and Get() RPCs to key/value servers (called kvraft servers), which then place those calls into the Raft log and execute them in order. A client can send an RPC to any of the kvraft servers, but should retry by sending to a different server if the server is not currently a Raft leader, or if there's a failure. If the operation is committed to the Raft log (and hence applied to the key/value state machine), its result is reported to the client. If the operation failed to commit (for example, if the leader was replaced), the server reports an error, and the client retries with a different server.

Inorder to build a fault-tolerant key/value storage system. We need to implement Raft, a replicated state machine protocol. A replicated service (e.g., key/value database) achieves fault tolerance by storing copies of its data on multiple replica servers. Replication allows the service to continue operating even if some of its servers experience failures (crashes or a broken or flaky network). The challenge is that failures may cause the replicas to hold differing copies of the data.

Raft manages a service's state replicas, and in particular it helps the service sort out what the correct state is after failures. Raft implements state machine replication. It organizes client requests into a sequence, called the log, and ensures that all the replicas agree on the contents of the log. Each replica executes the client requests in the log in the order they appear in the log, applying those requests to the replica's local copy of the service's state. Since all the live replicas see the same log contents, they all execute the same requests in the same order, and thus continue to have identical service state. If a server fails but later recovers, Raft takes care of bringing its log up to date. Raft will continue to operate as long as at least a majority of the servers are alive and can talk to each other. If there is no such majority, Raft will make no progress, but will pick up where it left off as soon as a majority can communicate again.

We implemented Raft as a Go object type with associated methods, meant to be used as a module in a larger service. A set of Raft instances talk to each other with RPC to maintain replicated logs. Our Raft interface will support an indefinite sequence of numbered commands, also called log entries. The entries are numbered with index numbers. The log entry with a given index will eventually be committed. At that point, Our Raft should send the log entry to the larger service for it to execute.
